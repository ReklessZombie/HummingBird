HummingBird
===========

Welcome to Hummingbird Simulator 2014!

Objective
•Live as long as possible, collecting flowers and avoiding the predators! Collecting flowers replenishes your hummingbird’s energy bar, while flying around and hitting predators deplete it.

Controls

•W – move up. Hold to continuously move upwards.

•A – move right. Hold to continuously move right.

•S – move down. Hold to continuously move down.

•D – move left. Hold to continuously move left.

•Combinations of the controls can be used to move diagonally. For example, W + A will move the bird diagonally up and right.


Tips

•Try to conserve movement. Unnecessary navigation will waste energy and give time for the predators to close in.

•Make the most of your energy! If your meter is full, attempt to lure Predators away from the center. Collecting flowers at max energy is wasteful.
